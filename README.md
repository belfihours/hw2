## Bakery Website

The Idea is to structure a bakery website, that can show to its customers all the available products, give infos and the chance to review the bakery itself
This is exactly the same Website as [HW1](https://github.com/belfihours/hw1) but in this case I used Laravel (PHP framework)

### Features:

- Login, Signup e Logout
- Responsive Homepage (depending on logged or guest user)
- Use of Google Maps API
- Use of "Foodish" and "TheCocktailDb" APIs in order to change images in the main page
- Displayed products are split by categories, a searchbar is implemented. All products are in contents.php
- Feedback: Every customer can leave a classic review with star and additional comment
- In the main page on top of the ratings is displayed the average stars
- All the data is stored in a InnoDb MySQL storage
